MICDevCamp2014
==============

This repository contains our code for PhotoTrack, an application that
was developed in 3 days during the [MIC Summer Camp
2014](http://softlab.mic-belgique.be/summercamp), an open-source
hackathon organized by the Microsoft Innovation Center of Mons
(Belgium).

The code is released under the [AGPLv3
license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).

The specifications are available in the `Documents` folder. As this
code is the result of a intensive appathon, many tasks remain to be
done! Get in touch with the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) for more information ;)
